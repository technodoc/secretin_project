120 years have passed since the discovery of the first peptide hormone, secretin (SCT), yet our understanding of it remains limited. SCT is one of the enteroendocrine hormones, which together regulate the digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients in the digestive system. Traditionally, the "one cell - one hormone" dogma has been used to classify enteroendocrine cells (EECs), with each type of EEC assigned to secrete only one hormone. scRNA-seq, a cutting-edge sequencing technology, provides a high-resolution analysis of gene expression at the individual cell level, enabling the study of cellular diversity and heterogeneity within complex biological systems.
The Gut Cell Atlas (GCA), the largest single-cell dataset of human intestinal cells currently available, was analysed and visualized using a variety of tools. The aim was to use the transcriptional information to determine whether the 'one cell - one hormone' dogma is still relevant in the 21st century. This study showed that almost all EECs produce multiple enteroendocrine hormones, contradicting the traditional dogma, and highlighting the need for a new classification that more accurately reflects the diversity of hormone expression within EECs. The study also calls into question the existence of S cells, suggesting that SCT is produced jointly by several other enteroendocrine subpopulations.
In the light of emerging pharmacotherapies based on peptides of the glucagon gene family for diabetes and obesity, a better understanding of EEC heterogeneity and their hormone expression patterns could lead to the development of more targeted and effective treatments to fight the growing epidemic of obesity and diabetes, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has described as one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century.
