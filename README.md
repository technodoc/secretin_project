# secretin_project
120 years have passed since the discovery of the first peptide hormone, secretin (SCT), but
still very little is known about it. SCT belongs to the enteroendocrine hormones, which
together regulate the digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients in the digestive
system. The dogma of “one cell – one hormone”, an ancient classification that assigns a
hormone to each enteroendocrine cell (EEC) type, is still used today to classify EECs.
In this study, we used newly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
data, which provide unprecedented resolution of cell-cell heterogeneity, to examine the
transcriptomes of individual enteroendocrine cell types. To this end, we analyzed the Gut
Cell Atlas (GCA), the largest single-cell dataset of intestinal cells currently available, using
a variety of analysis tools. Our goal was to examine the transcriptome information and
determine whether the “one cell – one hormone” dogma is still relevant in the 21st century.
We paid particular attention to the analysis of SCT expression and genes co-expressed
with it, which can provide information on the release mechanism.
Our study revealed that almost all EECs produce multiple hormones and that the
ratio of expressed hormones defines the cell type. We used the expression of multiple
hormones to define hormone co-expression profiles, which provide a new quantitative
approach to describing enteroendocrine subpopulations based on the co-expression of
multiple hormones in a cell. This study also suggests that SCT is not expressed by S
cells but that its secretion is realized jointly by multiple enteroendocrine subpopulations.
Finally, we present Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 1 Inhibitor (PCSK1N)
as a novel marker for high SCT expression.
